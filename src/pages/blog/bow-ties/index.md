The bow-tie (not to be confused with the tae bo) is an aphrodisiac worn by male humans attempting to win one or more mates. According to scientists (many of whom sport the style regularly), the bow-tie has been clinically proven to yield positive results. These findings were confirmed by the surge in popularity of the ties in the 1960's which led to a nation-wide public school banning. ([source](http://uncyclopedia.wikia.com/wiki/Bow_tie))
